This is a simple news app built using **Flutter**, created mainly for **learning and practice**.

## 💡 What does the app do?

It connects to a free News API and shows you the latest headlines in a clean list view. Each news card displays:

- 🖼 A thumbnail image  
- 📰 The article title  
- 📝 A short description  

You can use it to understand how networking works in Flutter and how to display real data on the screen.
